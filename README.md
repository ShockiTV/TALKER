# TALKER
A LLM powered dialogue generator for STALKER Anomaly

![TALKER](images/talker.png)

## notes
You will need openAI api credits to be able to use this mod! Changing the LLM model is possible, I left a door open for it at least in the code if anyone wants to give it a shot.

This mod is provided free of charge with open code, practice your own due diligence and set spending limits on your account. I have tested for bugs that could cause large amounts of requests but that does not mean it's impossible!

## installation instructions
Best to use [Mod Organizer](https://lazystalker.blogspot.com/2020/11/mod-organizer-2-stalker-anomaly-setup.html)

### get an openapi key
https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/
put it in the openAi_API_KEY.key file as it was a text file

### the game
1. place TALKER in a new mod folder, unpacked
2. install python if you dont have it already
3. run mic_python/intall_requirements.bat
4. run mic.bat
5. if it says everything's okay, keep it running and launch the game
6. you should be able to start speaking using the left alt key

### experimental alternative to python install
run the talkermic.exe and give it your key when prompted. Should work without the need for any installation.

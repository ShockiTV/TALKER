## notes
You will need openAI api credits to be able to use this mod! Changing the LLM model is possible, I left a door open for it at least in the code if anyone wants to give it a shot.

This mod is provided free of charge with open code, practice your own due diligence and set spending limits on your account. I have tested for bugs that could cause large amounts of requests but that does not mean it's impossible!
